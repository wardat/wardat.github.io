Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) has become a common buzzword nowadays in the Web. However, there is no search tool currently in place for discovering and learning about the different types of IoT elements. Hence, this paper presents a topical search engine for IoT. The motivation for a topical search engine comes from the relatively poor performance of general-purpose search engines, which depend on the results of generic Web crawlers. The topical search engine is a system that learns the specialization from examples, and then explores the Web, guided by a relevance and popularity rating mechanism. The results show that the proposed topical search engine outperforms other general search engines.
